version 0.8
Designed and Implemented by Team Mistaken Umbrella:
	Bill Beers
	Boom Amporndanai
	Doug Williams
	Geoff Mickey

This application requires a device that meets the following requirements:

	-Camera
	-Touch Screen
	-Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich)

Description:
	
	BlindFire was developed to enable users with impaired vision or NLP (No Light Perception)
	to take and review quality photographs using their Android-enabled device.

Features:

	-Vocal feedback provides users with guidance when positioning the camera, using 
	 facial recognition technology to allow them to take properly positioned photos without 	 the need for visual feedback.
	 (Not yet implemented)
	
	-Delayed mode uses vocal feedback to guide users into the frame without having to be 
	 behind the camera.  This allows users to take self-portraits or group pictures
	 with ease.
	 (Not yet implemented)

	-Users can use the gallery to review pictures and create short vocal messages for each 
	 image.  These messages can be played back later for more information on the image.
	 (Not fully implemented)

How to Use:

	When shooting photos in normal mode, hold the camera up so that your target is somewhere in the frame.  Follow the vocal feedback to position your camera so that your target falls within the center of the frame.  You may optionally change where in the frame you would like the target to fall by going into the settings or double-tapping in the corresponding region of the screen.  The vocal feedback will then give you directions to position your target in the specified region of the screen.  Press the shutter button on the center-right side of the screen to take the picture.

	When shooting photos in delayed mode, set the camera so that your target is somewhere in the frame.  Press the shutter button on the center-right side of the screen to begin the initial countdown.  The length of the countdown can be set in the settings menu, accessed by pressing the button in the lower-left side of the screen.  You can use this countdown to move yourself into the target area.  When the initial countdown finishes, the application will search for faces and delegate instructions so that the targets can adjust themselves in the frame.  If there are no faces in the frame, the application will state this and wait some time before taking the picture by default. When the targets are in the right position, the camera will wait for a few moments and then take the picture.

	The gallery can be accessed using the button in the upper-right side of the screen.  You can swipe or press the arrows on each side of the screen to scroll through the photos.  You may press the record button on the right-bottom side of the screen to record a personal message for the currently displayed image.  This recording can be played back by pressing the play button on the left-bottom side of the screen.  The title of the image may be changed by pressing the title bar located above the image and entering the desired title.  You may return to the camera screen at any time by pressing the back button or the camera button located on the right-top side of the screen.
